# Traceable evidence of the impacts of climate change on human pathogenic diseases

In this project, we carried out a systematic and comprihensive review of emperical case examples in which ten climatic hazards affected by greenhouse gasses (like warming, heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes, ocean biochemistry change, etc.) have affected human pathogenic diseases since the Roman Empire until COVID-19. 

We found that nearly 60% of all known pathegenic diseases that have affected humanity in recorded history have been at some point affected by climatic hazards sentive to greenhouse gases. 

By 2020, the CO2 concentration in the air has increased to 412.5 ppm from about 280ppm before the start of the industrial revolution, and each year is higher than the year before. So you make the math, and good luck to all of us.
